## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Rich Text Editor**: Tiptap for question/answer content creation
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API design
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Authentication**: Replit OIDC integration with Passport.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following core entities:
- **Users**: Stores user profiles from Replit auth
- **Questions**: Main content with title, content, votes, views
- **Answers**: Responses to questions with voting and acceptance
- **Tags**: Categorization system with color coding
- **Votes**: User voting on questions and answers
- **Notifications**: Real-time user notifications
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit OIDC for seamless integration
- **Strategy**: OpenID Connect with automatic user creation
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with 7-day expiry
- **Authorization**: Route-level protection with middleware

### Question & Answer System
- **Rich Content**: Tiptap editor for formatted text, links, images
- **Voting**: Upvote/downvote system for content quality
- **Acceptance**: Question authors can mark best answers
- **Tagging**: Multi-tag system for categorization
- **Search**: Tag-based filtering and sorting options

### Real-time Features
- **Notifications**: Vote, answer, and acceptance notifications
- **Live Updates**: Query invalidation for real-time data sync
- **View Tracking**: Automatic question view counting

### UI/UX Components
- **Design System**: Consistent shadcn/ui components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Radix primitives ensure ARIA compliance
- **Theming**: CSS custom properties for light/dark mode support

## Data Flow

### Question Creation Flow
1. User opens Ask Question modal
2. Form validation with Zod schemas
3. Rich text content processed by Tiptap
4. Tags selected/created with autocomplete
5. Backend creates question with tag associations
6. React Query cache invalidation triggers UI updates

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login -> redirects to Replit OIDC
2. Successful auth creates/updates user in database
3. Session stored in PostgreSQL with connect-pg-simple
4. Frontend receives user data via protected API endpoint
5. React Query manages auth state across components

### Voting System
1. User clicks vote buttons on questions/answers
2. Optimistic updates provide immediate feedback
3. Backend validates vote permissions and updates scores
4. Database constraints prevent duplicate voting
5. Real-time notifications sent to content authors

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Express.js, Passport.js for auth, express-session
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, @neondatabase/serverless, connect-pg-simple
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide icons, Tailwind CSS
- **Rich Text**: Tiptap editor with various extensions
